# Manoj-portfolio
My portfolio is designed to showcase my technical skills in Java, Full Stack Development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a professional platform to represent my work and abilities through clean, responsive design. Iâ€™ve included practical projects like a To-Do List app and an Age Calculator to highlight real-world problem-solving. The site also provides clear contact options and social links to facilitate networking and collaboration. Ultimately, this portfolio aims to enhance my career opportunities by building a strong digital presence.
